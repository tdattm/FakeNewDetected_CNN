# Fake News Detection with CNN

This repository implements a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for supervised learning to detect fake news. The model is trained on a pre-existing dataset and is designed to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can find the required libraries in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Datasets

## Model

The core of this project is a CNN-based architecture, specifically designed to classify news articles. It processes the textual data and extracts features using convolutional layers to classify news as fake or real.
